K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning Predictive Classification - R, Jupyter

o	Garnered a 94% accuracy rate by creating a model utilizing the K-NN classification machine learning algorithm to predict and classify a studentâ€™s knowledge on Electrical DC Machines
o	Used a wide range of R libraries such as tidyverse, tidymodels, and readxl for data extraction, cleaning, training, and modeling as well as integrating cross-validation techniques
